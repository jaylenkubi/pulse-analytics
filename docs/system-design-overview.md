## 4. Technical Decisions and Trade-offs

### 4.1 Monorepo Structure
- **Decision**: Use a monorepo approach for both frontend and backend
- **Why**: 
  - Simplified dependency management
  - Shared types and interfaces
  - Easier coordination of changes
  - Consistent tooling and configuration
- **Trade-offs**: 
  - Larger repository size
  - Potentially slower CI/CD pipelines
  - More complex build configuration

### 4.2 TypeScript Throughout
- **Decision**: Use TypeScript for both frontend and backend
- **Why**:
  - Type safety across the entire stack
  - Better developer experience with IDE support
  - Self-documenting code
  - Reduced runtime errors
- **Trade-offs**:
  - Additional build step
  - Learning curve for developers
  - Slightly more verbose code

### 4.3 NestJS for Backend
- **Decision**: Use NestJS framework instead of Express or Fastify directly
- **Why**:
  - Structured architecture with modules
  - Built-in dependency injection
  - Decorators for clean, declarative code
  - Enterprise-ready features
- **Trade-offs**:
  - Higher abstraction level
  - Potentially more overhead
  - Opinionated structure

### 4.4 Queue-Based Event Processing
- **Decision**: Process events asynchronously using queues
- **Why**:
  - Handle traffic spikes gracefully
  - Ensure data collection reliability
  - Enable horizontal scaling of processing
  - Decouple collection from processing
- **Trade-offs**:
  - Additional infrastructure complexity
  - Potential for delayed processing
  - Queue monitoring requirements

### 4.5 Caching Strategy
